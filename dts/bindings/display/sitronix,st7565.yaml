description: ST7565 / ST7567 128x64 LCD display controller

compatible: "sitronix,st7565fb"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
    height:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Height in pixel of the panel driven by the controller

    width:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Width in pixel of the panel driven by the controller

    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: RESET pin.

        The RESET pin of ST7565 is active low.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    rs-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: RS/A0 pin.

        The RS/A0 pin of ST7565 selects command or data register.
        Use LOW for control data and HIGH for display data.

    bias:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: Bias setting of the controller.

        Use 0 for 1/9 bias and 1 for 1/7 bias.
        Select 1/9
          bias = <0>;
        Select 1/7
          bias = <1>;

    regulator-ratio:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 6
      description: Regulator ratio setting of the controller.

        Value indicates value in the following list
        RR  Ratio
        0 = 3.0
        1 = 3.5
        2 = 4.0
        3 = 4.5
        4 = 5.0
        5 = 5.5
        6 = 6.0
        7 = 6.5

        i.e. for rr=2 4.0 ratio use
          regulator-ratio = <2>;

    ev-contrast-range:
      type: uint8-array
      required: false
      default: [0x10, 0x28]
      description: Electronic volume contrast adjustment range.

        Provide a range of contrast values from lowest to highest.
        Values are [minimum, maximum] for the ST7565 EV register
        which give lowest and highest desirable contrast.
        Contrast will be auto-adjusted to the middle value of this range.
        To fix contrast value, use the same for both min and max.
          ev-contrast-range = [3F 3F];
